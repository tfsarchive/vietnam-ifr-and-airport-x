AutoGate plugin
===============


Requirements
------------
* X-Plane 9.70 or 10.10 and later
* Windows XP or later, Mac OS 10.5 or later, Linux
* Scenery package with AutoGate Docking Guidance Systems (DGSs)


Installation
------------
* Quit X-Plane if you have it running.
* Remove any existing AutoGate plugin from your X-Plane/Resources/plugins folder.
* Copy the "AutoGate" folder into your X-Plane/Resources/plugins folder.
* Re-start X-Plane.
* You can verify that you have correctly installed the plugin by checking that it
  is listed on the Plugins → Plugin Admin → Plugin Information screen in X-Plane.


Operation
---------
* The DGS lights up as you approach the gate and displays your plane's distance
  and offset from the stopping point. For details refer to the accompanying file
  "Pilot Instructions, Type 2S display.pdf".
* The AutoGate animated jetway (if included in the scenery package) will dock 
  with your plane once you have engaged the parking brake and stopped your engines.
* On departure, the AutoGate animated jetway will undock from your plane when
  you disengage the parking brake and/or start your engines.


Compatible Planes
-----------------
* This plugin works with any plane that has a "boarding door location" entered
  on the Standard → Viewpoint screen in Plane-Maker.
* Docking Guidance Systems will display aircraft model numbers if a valid
  "ICAO code" has been entered on the Standard → Viewpoint screen.
